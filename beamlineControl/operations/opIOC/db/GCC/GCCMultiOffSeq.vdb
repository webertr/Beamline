# Checks to see if device Current PSET = 0

# This particular record reads the PSET value
# held in the ParamSet.vdb database.
# 
# This is called from OnOff.vdb, and happens
# when the PS is starting to shutdown.
# 
# This is called to set the PS current to zero. If it isn't zero already,
# this will save the current value.

# Process different links depending on if
# power supply Current PSET = 0
# 
# LNK1 if it is not 0.  Then the Value of PSET must
# be stored temporarily so that after it has been
# set to zero and the device has been turned off,
# it cab be set back to this value.
# 
# LNK2 if it is zero.  power supply Current PSET does not need
# to be temporarily stored and can directly proceed with
# shutdown of power supply.  This is important when the device had
# previously failed to turn off, because it will ensure that
# the temporarily stored value will not be overwritten by zero
# if there is another attempt to turn the device off, and if
# it does successfully turn off that time the PSET will
# be restored properly from the temporary storage.  If this was
# not done, the PSET would be restored to zero
